# BlueRing

Blue Ring is a native Octopus Deploy client for macOS. It lives in the menu bar and makes it quick and easy to manage your favourite projects.

NOTE: This is a side project that not associated with [Octopus](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy) at all.

## Goals:
* Deploy and promote releases of your favourite projects
* Mini Octopus Dashboard w/ of your favourite projects
* Notifications of Octopus events

## Work in progress

I've started with a simple macOS app shell and I've been re-learning swift and its frameworks.  Plan is to build a menu bar app that talks to a server and focused solely on a specific set of projects. i.e. a user's favorite projects.  The goal is to design an app that makes it quick and easy to deploy and promote releases.  

Under the hood, this will use RxSwift to wire everythign up and make it nice and interactive/responsive.  I've always liked the Reactive Extensions and this is a nice project to apply them.  Otherwise, I'll try ot keep it nice and simple!
