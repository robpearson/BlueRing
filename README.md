# BlueRing

Blue Ring is an _opinionated_ native macOS client for Octopus Deploy. It lives in the menu bar and makes it quick and easy to manage your favourite projects.

NOTE: This is a side project that not associated with [Octopus](https://octopus.com) at all.

## Goals:
* Deploy and promote releases of your favourite projects
* Mini Octopus Dashboard w/ of your favourite projects
* Notifications of Octopus events

## Work in progress

I've started with a simple macOS app shell and I've been re-learning swift and its frameworks.  The plan is to build a menu bar app that talks to an Octopus server and focuses solely on a specific set of projects. i.e. a user's favourite projects.  The goal is to design an app that makes it quick and easy to deploy and promote releases.  

Under the hood, this will use RxSwift to wire everything up and make it nice and interactive/responsive.  I've always liked the Reactive Extensions and this is a nice project to apply them.  Otherwise, I'll try to keep it nice and simple!
